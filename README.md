# Concurrent and Parallel Programming in Java ‚Äì Course Assignment

## üìò Overview
This repository contains our course assignment for the subject Concurrent and Parallel Programming, where we  implement and demonstrate key concepts of multithreading and concurrency control in Java. The goal is to explore how parallelism can improve performance and responsiveness in Java applications.
The code recursively goes through a folder and counts the number of PDF files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 21)  
- IntelliJ IDEA 

## üöÄ Features Implemented
The assignment includes the following core concurrency and parallelism features in Java:

### Thread Creation and Management
- Using Thread, Runnable, and Callable  
- Custom thread 

### Thread Synchronization
- synchronized keyword  
- Locks and ReentrantLock  
- Deadlock prevention techniques

### Inter-Thread Communication
- wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() methods  
- Producer-Consumer problem implementations
- Synchronized Queue

### Thread Pools and Executors
- ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService  
- Fixed and cached thread pools  
- Task scheduling and shutdown

### Concurrency Utilities
- CountDownLatch
